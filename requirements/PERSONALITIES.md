1. A 18 y.o. HSE student just moved to a new city, earns too little money and tries to save as hard as he can. Buys food regularly, can go to a further store if goods are cheaper there. He loves Coca-Cola and is ready to buy it at any time as soon as a discount appears.

1. A 42 y.o. middle-class man obsessed with a healthy lifestyle. Every week he needs a fixed set of eco-friendly food and household goods. These products are quite rare, so he would like to get notified whenever they are in stock. He combines morning jogging with shopping, so he wants to find a distant shop.

1. A 34 y.o. senior developer that doesn’t usually care about prices of regular goods, but still wants to save money on rare expensive purchases. His main priority is the quality of a product, so he pays close attention to reviews. He uses loyalty programs extensively, so prices for him may significantly vary from the usual ones.

1. A 25 y.o. ‘Perekrestok’ outlet public relations department employee responsible for promotion in third-party resources. He tries to reach the store’s target audience via the apps they use. He also wants to analyze as much data about their customers as possible.

1. A 72 y.o elderly woman with a small pension who is a little grumpy. She lives alone and often has to go to one of the nearest grocery stores.
